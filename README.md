# üìù Todo App

## Description
Todo App is a task management tool that allows users to efficiently manage their to-do list. You can add new todos that are saved on the server, delete existing ones, and update the title of a todo by double-clicking on it. The app also features a "Clear Completed" button to remove all completed tasks. Additionally, you can filter todos to show all, only completed, or only active items. There's a "Toggle" button that, when clicked, marks all todos as completed for quick management.
